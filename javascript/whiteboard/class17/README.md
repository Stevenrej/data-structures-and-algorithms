# Trees : Class 17

In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes. Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent. These constraints mean there are no cycles or "loops" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes in a single straight line.

## Challenge

Feature Tasks
Write a function called breadth first
Arguments: tree
Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered
NOTE: Traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach

## Approach & Efficiency

It was takihng it step by step to get and understanding of how the tree works in the breadth works.
