Remove a Node From a Linked List

## Approach, Efficiency & API

The removeNode function takes in a singly linked list and a value as input. It iterates through the linked list starting from the head, and compares the value of each node with the input value. When it finds a match, it removes that node by adjusting the next pointer of the previous node to point to the next of the matching node. It also returns the value of the removed node.

The approach of this function is straightforward and easy to understand. It iterates through the linked list and checks each node until it finds a match. It then removes the matching node by updating the pointers.

The time efficiency of this function is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case scenario, the function needs to iterate through the entire linked list to find the matching node. In the best case, when the node is the head of the list, the time complexity is O(1). The space efficiency of this function is O(1) as it uses only a single variable current which takes constant space regardless of the size of the list.

The API of this function is simple and easy to use. It takes in a singly linked list and a value as input and returns the value of the removed node. It also modifies the original linked list by removing the matching node. It's important to note that it assumes that the linked list is a singly linked list and that the value of the node is unique in the list.
